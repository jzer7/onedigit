# Single Digit Combination Finder

This is a number puzzle.
The object of the game is to find the best way to build a number based on a single digit.
For example, to build the number $75$ using the digit $3$, we can use $(3^3 - 3!)$.
It is more difficult to build $75$ using only the digit $6$, $(6+6)*6 + \frac{6*6}{6+6}$.
